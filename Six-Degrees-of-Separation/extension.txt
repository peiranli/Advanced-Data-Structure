With the extension file we create, we can take a list of friendship relationship
from facebook user databse as the resource file. With that file, we can find out
the number of common friends between any two users that are in the input file.
If any of the input user is not in the resource file, a error message will be 
print.
To solve this problem, we first created a user class that has a uid and a 
friend_list hashmap. It is enough to represent a facebook user with this class.
In the main method of extention, first we have the loadFromFile method. It takes
the resource file and form a global user_list hashmap. After that, every users'
friend list will be filled. Then we will find the two users from input and get 
their friend_lists. Compare their friend_lists to see how many overlappings
they have.
For the test part, we made up several different inputs of the resource files and
input uids. We finally made all of the test case passed.

To test the extension file, u just type in the terminal:
	make extension
Then u just type:
	./extension extension_input.tsv test_extension.tsv out_extension.tsv
